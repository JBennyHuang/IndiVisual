## Basics
1. Install <a href = "https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank"> Node.JS </a>

2. Clone this repository to a local directory

3. Use npm to install `nodemon` and all dependencies
	- Open terminal in the folder that contains `package.json`
	- In command line, execute `$ npm install -g nodemon` followed by `$ npm install`

4. To run the app
	- Open terminal in the folder that contains `app.js`
    - Execute the following command `$ nodemon app`
    - Hit `localhost:3000` on your browser URL bar

### Remarks 
- Note that the commands above are executed using Git Bash, commands might differ depending on your terminal
- Every time `package.json` is updated, you should execute `$ npm install` after you pull
- Every time you (un)install a node module, you should save it inside `package.json`
	> To do that, you must append `--save` to your (un)installation command, for example `$ npm install express --save`
